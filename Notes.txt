Bulletin board - empty, to my liking
Course schedule - empty, tml
personal data - form
    including: bank acc no -> merge to one page
    maybe, accordeon menu.
    Put your summary: pic, name, id, field of study, etc. fos most importantly
report card - most important part of webdziekanat
Additional and elective courses selection and summary - moderate
Fees - due and history, including tuition fee
Scholarships, generaly money stuff
medical exam expiration date -> prefereably as part of personal summary
Link to Podania i wnioski, maybe summary of placed ones. (w tym podanie o zakwaterowanie)
zapisy na examin i wf
external links:
- podania o dom studencki
- mLegitymacja
- podania in general
- ects course catalogue
- samorzÄ…d studencki
meetings and manadatory terms.

The whole thing makes no sense, so I propose to keep:
Bulletin - News.
Course schedule 
Personal data - view and edit, also snippet summary
report card - most important part
administrative - fees, paymants, scholarships, electives
external - links to given things

perhaps side menu with subchapters, each subchapter could be a tab.
